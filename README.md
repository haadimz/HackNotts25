Introduction:
In today’s digital landscape, personalized experiences are increasingly valued by users. Our project aims to create an interactive web application that presents users with sets of images grouped by thematic categories. Users are prompted to select images that appeal to them or resonate with their preferences. By collecting these selections across multiple themes, the system can analyze patterns in the user’s choices. The ultimate goal is to use a machine learning approach to infer certain traits, preferences, or characteristics about the user based on their selections and utilise this information to recommend products from the various Frasers group businesses. 

Problem we solve:
Traditional methods of understanding user preferences often rely on surveys, questionnaires, or explicit profile inputs, which can be time-consuming and prone to biases. Users may not always provide accurate or complete information about their preferences. Furthermore, existing image-based recommendation or personality inference systems are often static and do not dynamically adapt to user input in real-time.
Our project aims to :
  -Provide an interactive and intuitive image-based input system that encourages natural user choices.

  -Enable real-time collection of preference data without requiring lengthy forms.

  -Apply machine learning algorithms to infer insights about the user’s traits, preferences, or behavior based on selections, which can be more nuanced than   conventional surveys.
 - Utilise the assumed data about the user to recommend tailored products from Frasers group businesses e.g. Sports Direct.
